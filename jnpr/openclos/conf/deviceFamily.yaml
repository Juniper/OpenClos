# Device port usage based on device family and topology
# qfx5100-24q-2p ports could have 32 ports with two four-port expansion modules
# When used as Fabric, all ports are downlink ports
# When used as Spine in 3-Stage topology, all ports are used as downlink
# When used as Spine in 5-Stage topology, ports are split between uplink and downlink
